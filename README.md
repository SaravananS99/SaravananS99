# Hi, I'm Saravanan 👋

🎯 Embedded & Platform Engineer | Automotive Software | OTA | SDV | Multi-core Systems

I'm an embedded engineer with 2.5+ years of experience in the **platform team** of a major automotive supplier. I work on **embedded service integration**, **OTA deployment**, and **pipeline-based delivery systems** for Software-Defined Vehicles (SDVs).

---

### 🚀 What I Work On

- 🧠 **Platform Service Development** – Embedded C++ services for ultrasonic sensor systems (USS)
- 🔁 **Multi-core Integration** – A72 (Linux) + R5 cores using IPC wrappers (e.g., RPMsg)
- 📦 **OTA Deployment Pipelines** – Using **Wind River Studio** to manage OTA-ready builds  
- ⚙️ **Build & Release** – Configure and monitor pipelines that generate Yocto-based images
- 🤖 **ML Component Integration** – Assist in integrating ML modules into system pipelines

### 📌 Repositories Coming Soon

I'm currently focusing on building clean, small-scale projects to improve my coding fundamentals and embedded system understanding:

- 🔧 `embedded-c-utils` – A collection of low-level C utilities for memory, strings, and bit manipulation
- 🧪 `cpp-state-machine` – A modern C++11/14 state machine for embedded-style service lifecycle control
- 🔁 `ipc-mock-simulator` – Simulate inter-core communication logic using queues and shared memory (no hardware needed)
- 🛠️ `platform-sandbox` – A playground to simulate embedded service init, logging, and heartbeat-like behavior
- 📓 `system-notes` – Clean, well-documented notes and diagrams about embedded platforms, pipelines, and architecture

These are designed to be **simple but real**, and to showcase how I think, code, and structure embedded platform logic.
